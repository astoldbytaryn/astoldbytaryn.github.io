		<h2>Welcome to the Show!</h2>
	<p>My name is Taryn! I am 18+ part-time video game streamer and content creator. I started to stream in 2022 as a way to make new friends and share my love of gaming with new people. Twitch is my main platform that I choose to stream on and after a month of streaming on Twitch, I reached affiliate. Twitch Affiliate means that you can start to earn money through subscribers, have personal emotes for your community and other bonuses! I hope to continue to stream and be able to reach a point that I can become a full-time paid streamer!
		There are other platforms such as: TikTok and Youtube that someone could also become a streamer through. I hope to expand to Youtube very soon! </p>
